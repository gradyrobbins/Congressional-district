# Congressional-district

You're going to create an HTML component to represent a political candidate. Specifically, the representative of your Congressional district. Visit the GovTrack site link below, enter in your home address, and you'll find basic information about your representative.

GovTrack - Congressional District Map

In your HTML, create an article tag that will serve as your main representative component. Give the element a unique identifier.
In this component, create a sub-component for basic information using the section tag. In this section create elements for the representative's image, name, district info, and political affiliation.
Beneath the basic information, you will create a sub-component, using a section tag, to list any committees the candidate is serving on.
The last component will hold links to any legislation that your representative has enacted.
Make sure you use good BEM-style class names for each element in your components. Put a comment above each component explaining what it is.

Advanced challenge
In JavaScript, there is a method that creates a new attribute node for any DOM element. Discover that method and use it to create a custom attribute named congressional-district and its value should be your congressional district number. Then attach that attribute to the <article> container you made for your representative component.





Grady,

I need your help.

I'm trying to design a software service that allows users to claim their address via email or other social media.  The benefit to the user allows the user to receive information curated for that user's specific location and to allow the user to log in and view a dashboard of their representatives.

I've got a general "ballpark" cost from an acquaintance developer that most of their apps etc are a minimum cost of about $20k.  That doesn't sound that far off to me, but I'm curious if you or someone you know could generally provide a second opinion?

Hope all is well.

Let's talk soon,

to me

Similar yes, but the overall goal is to connect the voter with their particular representative's position/vote. So, for example, I'm represented in the US House by Michael Guest, I can log on to my dashboard and see how he is representing me on particular issues/bills.  Apps exist to show me who my representatives are, so I want to build a content sharing/publishing feature on top of that.

I think some of the content would be user-generated and other content would be licensed or written by me at first.
